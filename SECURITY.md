# Security Considerations for AWS FinOps Module

This document outlines security best practices and considerations when using the AWS FinOps Terraform module.

## Security Features

### Encryption
- **S3 Bucket Encryption**: All S3 buckets created by this module use server-side encryption
  - Default: SSE-S3 (AES256)
  - Optional: KMS encryption with customer-managed keys
- **Data in Transit**: All communications use TLS 1.2+ encryption

### Access Controls
- **S3 Public Access**: All S3 buckets have public access blocked by default
- **IAM Least Privilege**: IAM roles created follow the principle of least privilege
- **Bucket Policies**: Restrictive bucket policies that only allow AWS billing services

### Resource Isolation
- **Resource Tagging**: Comprehensive tagging for cost allocation and security classification
- **Environment Separation**: Support for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Security Best Practices

### 1. KMS Encryption
```hcl
module "finops" {
  source = "./finops"
  
  enable_kms_encryption = true
  kms_key_arn          = "arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/key-id"
}
```

### 2. Secure Budget Actions
- Use IAM policies with minimal required permissions
- Implement approval workflows for budget actions
- Monitor and audit budget action executions

### 3. Notification Security
- Use SNS topics with encryption for budget notifications
- Implement proper email security for budget alerts
- Consider using AWS ChatBot for Slack/Teams integration

### 4. Access Management
- Use AWS Organizations for multi-account cost management
- Implement cross-account IAM roles with minimal permissions
- Regular access reviews and permission audits

## Security Monitoring

### CloudTrail Integration
Enable CloudTrail to monitor:
- Budget creation and modifications
- Budget action executions
- S3 bucket access patterns
- IAM role usage

### CloudWatch Alarms
Set up alarms for:
- Unusual budget threshold breaches
- Failed budget action executions
- S3 bucket access anomalies

### AWS Config Rules
Implement compliance rules for:
- S3 bucket encryption requirements
- IAM role permission boundaries
- Budget notification configurations

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data
- Budget amounts and thresholds may be considered sensitive
- Cost usage reports contain detailed billing information
- Ensure proper access controls and encryption

### Compliance Requirements
- **SOC 2**: Implement logging and monitoring for budget actions
- **PCI DSS**: Ensure cost data doesn't contain cardholder data
- **GDPR**: Consider data residency requirements for cost reports

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Data Exposure**: Use KMS encryption for sensitive cost data
2. **Unauthorized Actions**: Implement approval workflows for budget actions
3. **Resource Abuse**: Set up monitoring for unusual cost patterns
4. **Access Control**: Regular review of IAM permissions

## Security Configuration Examples

### High Security Configuration
```hcl
module "finops" {
  source = "./finops"
  
  enable_kms_encryption = true
  kms_key_arn          = var.kms_key_arn
  
  budgets = {
    security-budget = {
      name              = "Security Monitoring Budget"
      budget_type       = "COST"
      limit_amount      = 1000
      limit_unit        = "USD"
      time_period_start = "2024-01-01_00:00"
      time_unit         = "MONTHLY"
      notifications = [
        {
          comparison_operator        = "GREATER_THAN"
          threshold                  = 80
          threshold_type             = "PERCENTAGE"
          notification_type          = "ACTUAL"
          subscriber_sns_topic_arns  = [var.security_sns_topic_arn]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-Account Security
```hcl
# Central account for cost management
module "finops_central" {
  source = "./finops"
  
  budgets = {
    organization-budget = {
      name              = "Organization Cost Budget"
      budget_type       = "COST"
      limit_amount      = 50000
      limit_unit        = "USD"
      time_period_start = "2024-01-01_00:00"
      time_unit         = "MONTHLY"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable KMS encryption for S3 buckets
- [ ] Configure proper IAM roles with least privilege
- [ ] Set up CloudTrail logging
- [ ] Implement budget action approval workflows
- [ ] Configure secure notification channels
- [ ] Regular security audits and reviews
- [ ] Monitor for unusual cost patterns
- [ ] Implement proper tagging for security classification

## Incident Response

### Budget Breach Response
1. Immediately review budget action triggers
2. Investigate cost anomalies
3. Implement temporary cost controls
4. Document incident and lessons learned

### Security Incident Response
1. Assess scope of potential data exposure
2. Review access logs and CloudTrail events
3. Implement containment measures
4. Notify relevant stakeholders
5. Conduct post-incident review

## Security Support

For security issues or questions:
- Create a security issue in the repository
- Contact the security team directly
- Follow your organization's security incident procedures
